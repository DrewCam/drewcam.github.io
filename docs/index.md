## A Little Bit About Me

Scottish-born, Aussie by choice since 2005. Cyber Security Analyst by profession, focusing on Microsoft Cloud technologies. This is my wee corner of the net to share the bits and bobs that I find interesting or might help someone out there.

## My Work Journey

- **From Building to Bartending**: Started off as an apprentice shopfitter, then spent a good ten years mixing drinks and running bars.
- **Tech Transition**: Shifted gears into tech - started as a Service Desk Analyst, then Systems Admin, and now, I'm all about cybersecurity.
- **Uni Life**: Decided to hit the books in my mid-20s. Started with Computer Science, then found my calling in Cyber Security, graduating from Edith Cowan University with a BsC.
- **What I Do Now**: Cyber Security Analyst: frontliner, constantly learning, and always tinkering. On the path of tackling certifications to stay sharp.

## Life Beyond Work

- **Gamer at Heart**: Used to be big into Dota 2, but now I'm a bit more casual.
- **Tech and Productivity Enthusiast**: Love tinkering with gadgets and finding new ways to be productive.
- **Sharing's Caring**: I believe in sharing knowledge and picking up new things from the cyber community.
