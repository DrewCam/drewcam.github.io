# Passing SC-200: My Journey and Tips

## Introduction

As a Cyber Security Analyst working daily with Microsoft Sentinel and Defender, passing the SC-200 exam was a must have for me. Here's a detailed account of my preparation journey, challenges, and the strategies that ultimately led to success. Whether you're just starting or refining your study plan, I hope my experience helps you navigate your path to certification.

## Exam Overview

The SC-200 exam focuses on three primary areas:

1. **Mitigate threats using Microsoft 365 Defender (25–30%)**
2. **Mitigate threats using Defender for Cloud (15–20%)**
3. **Mitigate threats using Microsoft Sentinel (50–55%)**

You can find more details on the official Microsoft Learn page: [Exam SC-200: Microsoft Security Operations Analyst](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/sc-200/).

## My Preparation Journey

### Understanding My Weaknesses

Despite my extensive experience with Microsoft Sentinel and Defender, I failed my first attempt. I realized my weakness was in Defender for Cloud, which we don't manage for many of our clients. This insight was crucial for adjusting my study plan and focusing on weaker areas.

### Study Resources

**Microsoft Learn Modules**:
I completed the MS Learn modules twice. First, I went through the standard SC-200 materials and then through the instructor-led modules. This comprehensive approach helped reinforce my knowledge and identify gaps.

**Hands-on Labs**:
I did the labs hands-on initially and then used the interactive step-throughs to keep the concepts fresh. Practical experience is invaluable for this exam.

**Practice Exams**:
I used both the Microsoft Learn practice exams and Whizlabs. These were instrumental in familiarizing myself with the exam format and timing.

**Kusto Query Language (KQL)**:
KQL is a significant component of the exam. I mainly focused on resources like:

- [MustLearnKQL GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rod-trent/MustLearnKQL)
- [KQL Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/marcusbakker/KQL/blob/master/kql_cheat_sheet.pdf)
- [Kusto Detective Agency](https://detective.kusto.io/)

### Additional Learning Resources

**YouTube**:
I found the AzureVlog YouTube channel particularly useful for deployment and threat hunting videos. It's a great resource for visual learners.

**Udemy**:
I tried the following Udemy courses:

- [SC-200 Microsoft Security Operations Analyst Course & SIMs](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-security-operations-analyst-course-sims/)
- [SC-200: Microsoft Security Operations Analyst](https://www.udemy.com/course/sc-200-microsoft-security-operations-analyst-exam-prep/)

Although I didn't finish either course, they provided valuable insights and structured learning paths.

**ESI Instructor-Led Training**:
I attended two ESI instructor-led sessions. The first was excellent, while the second showed signs of outdated content and labs. Nevertheless, these sessions were highly beneficial for interactive learning.

### Exam Strategy

Microsoft exams now give you access to MS Learn. My advice is to save this for questions you've marked for review. If you're unsure about an answer, making an educated guess is better than leaving it blank.

During my exam, I encountered one case study and around 50 questions. The exam was very Kusto and Defender for Cloud heavy, so be prepared for that.

## Applied Skills

While studying for SC-200, don't forget to complete the MS Applied Skill [Configure SIEM security operations using Microsoft Sentinel - Applied Skills](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/applied-skills/configure-siem-security-operations-using-microsoft-sentinel/). This will enhance your practical skills in deploying and managing Sentinel, a critical part of the SC-200 exam.

### Microsoft Applied Skills

Microsoft describes Applied Skills as targeted validation for real-world scenarios. These skills help you:

- Focus on specific, critical business problems.
- Earn credentials through hands-on, scenario-based assessments.
- Elevate your professional profile with verified Microsoft credentials.

You can find more about Microsoft Sentinel skill-up training here: [Microsoft Sentinel skill-up training](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/skill-up-resources).

### Additional KQL Resources

Another excellent resource is the [KQLCheat by Fortytwo - Interactive KQL Cheatsheet](https://kqlcheat.byfortytwo.com/). It's a handy tool for quickly referencing KQL syntax and functions.

## Conclusion

Passing the SC-200 exam is challenging but achievable with the right resources and strategies. Focus on your weaker areas, leverage hands-on labs, and utilize various study materials to ensure a well-rounded preparation. Good luck with your certification journey!
