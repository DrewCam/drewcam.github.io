# Threat Hunt - Volt Typhoon

## Hypothesis

Based on the advisory from the [ACSC](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-actor-living-off-the-land-to-evade-detection), [WA Cyber Security Unit (DGOV Technical)](https://soc.cyber.wa.gov.au/advisories/20230525001-State-Sponsored-Cyber-Actor-Living-off-the-Land-to-Evade-Detection/?h=volt) and observations detailed by [Microsoft](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-actor-living-off-the-land-to-evade-detection) on the Volt Typhoon's methods, the hypothesis for this threat hunt revolves around the likelihood that the Volt Typhoon threat group is actively exploiting critical infrastructure systems within our monitored environments by employing living-off-the-land techniques. These techniques include the creation of domain controller installation media, establishment of internal proxies, and use of custom FRP executables to avoid detection and maintain persistence.

<!-- more -->

### Assumptions

1. Volt Typhoon could use known living-off-the-land binary (LOLBin) commands and procedures, as indicated by past behaviours targeting similar entities in the U.S.
2. There is a potential that despite no detections by current signature-based tools, these adversaries might be operating undetected due to their sophisticated use of native tools and processes.
3. The custom SHA256 hashes associated with FRP executables represent Volt Typhoon’s custom tools, previously identified in engagements and potentially updated to evade signature-based detection.

### Investigation Goals

- **Verify the absence of known Volt Typhoon tactics:** Use historical and current logs to ensure that there have been no executions of suspicious command lines or process creations that align with Volt Typhoon's modus operandi.
- **Scrutinize for anomalies or outliers:** Given the group’s known reliance on LOLBins and stealth tactics, any unusual use of system tools or commands related to domain controller configuration, proxy settings, and known malicious hashes should be closely examined.
- **Proactive threat identification:** Even if Volt Typhoon's specific signatures are not found, it is critical to identify deviations from baseline behaviours that might indicate similar adversary TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

### Hypothesized Activities to Monitor

- **Creation of Domain Controller Installation Media:** Look for the execution of `ntdsutil` with commands related to creating or exporting domain controller databases, a technique possibly used for lateral movement or establishing persistence.
- **Establishment of Internal Proxies:** The use of `netsh portproxy` commands might indicate attempts to reroute internal traffic or exfiltrate data discreetly.
- **Execution of Custom FRP Executables:** Monitoring for any execution or deployment of known bad SHA256 hashed executables will help identify potentially malicious activities, even if those files have been slightly modified.

[SuspectedLSASSDump](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Solutions/Windows%20Security%20Events/Hunting%20Queries/SuspectedLSASSDump.yaml) Looks for evidence of the LSASS process being dumped either using Procdump or comsvcs.dll. Often used by attackers to access credentials stored on a system.

```kusto
  SecurityEvent 
  | where EventID == 4688
